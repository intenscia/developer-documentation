Contributing
-----------
 1. `Pull` the latest `develop` branch.
 2. Branch off of `develop`. Use the following syntax for branches:
 	- feature/{feature name}
 	- bug/{bug name}
 	- resource/{documentation content}
 	- task/{task name}
 3. Make changes. `Commit` early and often. `Push` to Github at least daily.
 4. When your objective is complete, submit a pull request to merge your branch with `develop`. If you are contributing documentation, tag with `under review` to prevent premature merging.
 5. If your PR is for a feature, bug, or task, a team member will review the code style and ensure the solution conforms to best practices. If your PR is for documentation, the designated editor will review your work to ensure that it conforms with the style guide and presents a unified voice. In either case, the reviewer will add line notes for changes.
 6. After all necessary changes are made, the reviewer will merge.
 7. The submitter is responsible for deleting their branch upon completion.
