# Labs

The Labs API is a testing ground for experimental endpoints that aren't quite ready for primetime. **They may change, break or disappear at any time.** Labs API seats are limited and credentials are separate from the Production API. To request access, please email [support@luc.id](mailto:support@luc.id).
