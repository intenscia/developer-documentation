## Authentication

```plaintext
GET  https://stg-api.samplicio.us/Demand/v1/Surveys/BySurveyNumber/22789
```

The Fulcrum API uses HTTP Authorization header for authentication. Every call should have a header `Authorization: {{APIkey}}`. Ensure that the key you are passing is the correct key for the environment. If you don't already have a Fulcrum account, get started by [signing up for a demo](https://luc.id/fulcrum/)!
