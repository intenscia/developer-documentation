## Environments

Fulcrum has two environmentsâ€”production and sandbox. The sandbox environment is used during development and for testing. There are no live respondents in this environment (although you may enter as a respondent), and it is not possible to incur any charges as a result of calls in the sandbox. It is important to note that lookup libraries in the sandbox are different from those in production. Production should only be used once an application has been thoroughly tested in staging. Developers are financially responsible for any transactions made on the system regardless of whether it was the result of a bug.
