# Introduction

Lucid brings efficiency and automation to online sampling with Fulcrum, todayâ€™s most powerful, open, and customizable online sampling platform.

The Fulcrum API provides a simple way to connect to millions of people and get answers in real time. By specifying a set of demographic qualifications and quotas, buyers can target a wide or very specific population on a topic of your choosing. As a supplier, the Fulcrum API gives you fine grain control over your yield and business relationships on the platform. 

Built on RESTful principles, the API uses HTTP methods and verbs. Both JSON and XML requests are supported. JSON is returned by all responses.

To make the API as explorable as possible, each account has production and sandbox API keys and endpoints. Just use the appropriate key and endpoint to perform a live or test call. Requests made with sandbox credentials never hit the Exchange and incur no cost. 

We do not currently rate limit calls because we believe that would only limit your potential to innovate. Please be practical and considerate when determining call frequencies.
